## Instruction
First, download the GlaS dataset and put it into ../datasets/.

## Environment setup
For the mask-attention modules, please follow the instructions in https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former/blob/main/INSTALL.md

For the dilated dilated-neighborhood attention structure, please follow the instructions in https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer


## Data preparation
We follow the dataset preparation process in Mask2former, so please follow the instructions in https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former/blob/main/datasets/README.md
